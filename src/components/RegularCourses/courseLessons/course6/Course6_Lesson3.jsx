                We've looked at what spread betting is and how it works, but you
                may be wondering about the advantages of placing a spread bet
                rather than trading in the more traditional way. Let's take a
                look at the reasons to choose spread betting.
              </p>
              <h1>Tax-free profits</h1>
              <p>
                When you trade financial assets in the traditional way, you
                normally have to pay <b>capital gains tax</b> (CGT) on any
                profits you make. However, spread betting is classNameed as
                gambling, which is exempt from CGT.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's also free from stamp duty -&nbsp;a tax you typically face
                when trading shares. That's because you never physically own any
                shares with spread betting, you just bet on their value.
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember that tax laws are subject to change and depend on
                individual circumstances. Tax law may differ in a jurisdiction
                other than the UK.
              </p>
              <h1>No commission</h1>
              <p>
                If you trade physical financial assets through a broker, you'll
                normally pay commission. This doesn't apply with spread betting
                as the charges are typically included in the <b>spread</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since brokers often charge a minimum fee for every transaction,
                paying a spread is usually cheaper than paying commission on an
                equivalent transaction, particularly for smaller deal sizes.
              </p>
              <h1>Capitalising on falling markets</h1>
              <p>
                In traditional trading, you normally buy an asset in the hope
                its value will rise, so you can sell for a profit. However, with
                spread betting you can equally well take a view on an asset you
                expect will fall in value -&nbsp;known as <b>going short</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                As you're simply betting on the direction you think a price will
                take, you can keep dealing even in bearish markets.

              <h1>Thousands of markets</h1>
              <p>
                With traditional trading, you might have to use separate brokers
                specialising in different asset types, such as shares or foreign
                exchange. However, most spread betting providers offer a diverse
                range of global financial markets, all together on a single
                platform.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can also spread bet on markets that are difficult to access
                in other ways. Stock indices, for example, can't be bought or
                sold directly, but you can spread bet on their movements.
              </p>
              <h1>24-hour dealing</h1>
              <p>
                Most markets have set dealing hours. The FTSE 100, for example,
                is only open from 8am to 4.30pm in the underlying market.
                Ordinarily, after it closes for the night, you'd have to wait
                until the following morning before you can deal.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may, however, find that some spread betting providers allow
                you to deal round-the-clock on certain markets. This means that,
                even if the market you're betting on is shut, you can still open
                and close your bets.

              <p>
                With conventional trading you generally need to pay the full
                purchase price of an asset up front. Spread betting, however, is
                a leveraged product. So when you place a spread bet your
                provider will ask you to put up a sum representing
                <b>just a fraction of the total value</b> of the position.

              <h1>The risks of using leverage</h1>
              <p>
                Leverage can work to your advantage when you spread bet, however
                it's important to remember that both profits <b>and losses</b>
                are based on the full size of your bet. This means they could
                far outweigh the size of your initial deposit. So leverage is a
                benefit of spread betting, but also its biggest risk.

                You can look at leverage in more detail in the
