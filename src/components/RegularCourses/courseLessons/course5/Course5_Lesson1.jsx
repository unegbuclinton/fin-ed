                So far, we've explored many different aspects of the financial
                markets and the techniques of trading. But there's one key
                component that affects the success of every trade you make, and
                that's <b>you</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                No matter how strong or level-headed you can be, you are a human
                being, so you have emotions. And naturally your feelings can
                influence your thinking and your behaviour as a trader.

                Trading is an exciting and absorbing activity that can bring you
                moments of euphoria when things are going well, while equally it
                can be psychologically tough if markets turn against you. By
                understanding the emotions you're likely to experience at every
                point in the trading process, you can mentally prepare yourself
                to handle them effectively. That way, your feelings won't get in
                the way of your decision-making or harm your potential profits.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this course, we'll look at some of the emotions you may need
                to deal with when you trade.
              </p>
              <h1>Anxiety and doubt</h1>
              <p>
                It's great to be cautious and considered in your trading, but if
                your worries are crippling you that's counter-productive.
              </p>
              <p>
                The transition to a live trading account after using 'play'
                money in a demo environment is one step that worries some
                traders. It's a bit like doing a parachute jump: you've learned
                the theory and done all the preparation, but making that leap
                still takes courage.

                There are, however, things you can do to make it a little less
                daunting:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Reflect on the lessons you learned while using the demo
                  account
                </li>
                <li>
                  Apply the same strategies that brought you success in demo
                  trades
                </li>
                <li>Follow a trading plan</li>
                <li>
                  Start by trading in small sizes until you feel comfortable
                </li>
                <li>Use risk-management tools, such as stop-losses</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                As long as you trade sensibly, use the skills and knowledge
                you've already gained and keep your positions modest, there's
                every reason to expect success. Of course you will make mistakes
                -&nbsp;we all do -&nbsp;but by managing risk carefully you'll
                minimise your losses.
              </p>
              <h1>Fear of loss</h1>
              <p>
                Another time that you might experience fear is when a position
                is moving against you and you begin to see a growing loss.
              </p>
            </div>

          <div className="lesson-content parbase section">

                Example
              </h2>
              <div className="example_text">
                Imagine you've bought EUR/USD because your analysis strongly
                suggests it's about to rise. You've considered the risk involved
                and set a stop-loss.
              </div>
              <div className="example_text">
                However, as time passes the currency pair seems to be stuck in a
                downtrend. It hasn't hit your stop, but the rise you predicted
                remains elusive. You start to feel nervous: should you close the
                position now and cut your losses? Should you adjust your stop
                closer?
              </div>
              <div className="example_text">
                Before taking any action, ask yourself:
              </div>
              <ul>
                <li>Was my original analysis flawed?</li>
                <li>
                  Have circumstances affecting this market changed since I
                  opened my trade?
                </li>
                <li>Did I place my stop at the wrong level?</li>
              </ul>
              <div className="example_text">
                If everything suggests your original analysis is still valid,
                and if you've positioned your stop correctly to protect yourself
                against unacceptable loss, there's no reason to alter or kill
                your trade. Have confidence in your original judgment and let
                things play out -&nbsp;your loss could turn into a profit.

                <li>
                  Your emotional state can have a strong influence on the bottom
                  line of your trading, so it's important to learn how to manage
                  your feelings
                </li>
                <li>
                  Don't allow doubts and fears to paralyse you. Markets move
                  swiftly, and hesitation can lead to missed opportunities
                </li>
                <li>
                  By following a plan, trading in small sizes and using risk
                  management tools, you'll feel more secure and confident in
                  your trading decisions
