                While some emotions may make you hesitate to trade, others can
                have the opposite effect, causing you to act when you really
                shouldn't.
              </p>
              <h1>Impatience</h1>
              <p>
                Rather than being paralysed by nerves, some new traders have a
                quite different reaction and can't wait to jump into the
                markets. This can be even more damaging.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the saying goes, 'a little knowledge is a dangerous thing',
                and launching yourself into a trade before you're fully prepared
                is a sure route to disappointment. First consider this
                checklist:
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Are you ready to trade?</b>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Are you comfortable using your trading platform and do you
                  know how to apply the tools it provides?
                </li>
                <li>Have you created a trading plan?</li>
                <li>
                  Do you fully understand all the factors currently affecting
                  the market you want to trade?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Have you planned your trade, considered your objectives and
                  calculated the potential profit and loss?
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                If you can answer '<b>yes</b>' to all of these questions, and if
                your proposed trade fits your trading plan, you're ready to go.
              </p>
              <p>
                Similarly, exercise restraint when it comes to open positions.
                After entering a trade, you should give the market time to react
                as you expect it to -&nbsp;don't get impatient and trade out
                before the market has had time to move.
              </p>
              <h1>Temptation and greed</h1>
              <p>
                When your trades are going well, it's only natural to be excited
                about the potential for even greater gains.
              </p>
              <p>
                But at these moments it's vital to stick to the rules of your
                trading plan. If the signs indicate it's time to close a trade
                and take your profit, it's probably not a good idea to keep
                holding on in the hope of making even more money.

                The same goes when you see an enticing opportunity to trade.
                Suppose you know an experienced trader who tells you he thinks
                Trendy Online Retail Group plc is about to see a surge in its
                share price. You might be tempted to place a large trade, even
                if it goes against your trading plan.
              </p>
              <p>
                But it's important to remind yourself that your plan is there
                for a reason: to take the emotion out of trading decisions. If
                the risk posed by this trade is outside the parameters you would
                normally consider, you should decline to get involved
                -&nbsp;however convinced your friend may be.
              </p>
              <h1>Happiness and pride</h1>
              <p>
                When a trade goes well, you're likely to feel a surge of
                pleasure and satisfaction. Naturally you'll be proud of your
                achievement. And if a series of trades all turn a profit, you
                may even start to feel invincible.

                These emotions, although positive, can also be dangerous. At
                times like this, irrepressible optimism can set in, encouraging
                you to take risks that would normally be outside your comfort
                zone.

                We humans tend to see patterns in everything, so a sequence of
                successful trades may convince you that you're 'on a winning
                streak'. However, remember the universe doesn't work that way:
                your next trade could just as easily result in a loss, so if you
                over-commit yourself you could be in for a painful shock.
              </p>

                Always be aware of the way your mood is affecting your trading
                decisions. By controlling your excitement and staying calm
                you're more likely to think clearly and make informed, prudent
                choices.

                  Sensible restraint is vital. Don't trade impulsively without
