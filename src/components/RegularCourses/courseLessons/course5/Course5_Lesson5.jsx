                No trader gets it right every time. We all make occasional
                mistakes, and that's nothing to be ashamed of -&nbsp;in fact,
                it's often a good way to learn.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, you can reduce your risk of blunders by being aware of
                the pitfalls that frequently catch out other traders. In this
                section we'll run through some of these common errors, so you
                can learn from the mistakes of others and steer clear of them
                yourself.

                As Benjamin Franklin said, 'By failing to prepare, you are
                preparing to fail'. And in the world of trading such failure can
                cause significant financial pain, so it really does pay to do
                your homework before you venture into the markets.

                You may know of some experienced, successful traders who make it
                look easy. But unfortunately trading is not just a case of
                opening a position and waiting for the profits to roll in - a
                degree of skill and knowledge is essential.

                Too many new traders rush in with misguided confidence and are

              <p>
                Suppose you needed to travel from Edinburgh to New York: would
                you just step out of the door and set off without researching
                your route or checking ticket availability? Without doing a
                little advance planning, you would be unlikely to arrive at your
                destination.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the same way, heading into a trade without having a plan can
                get you into trouble.

                In the 'Planning and risk management' course, we talked in
                detail about how to create a trading plan. Once you've done
                that, it's important to stick to the course you've plotted for
                yourself.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may be tempted, every day, to ignore your trading plan and
                just stay in a little longer on this trade or go in heavy on
                that one. But if you've really taken the time to develop your
                trading plan then you should have faith in it being the
                best-suited approach for you.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even the best trading plan remains only a guide, but the better
                the guide, and the better you can follow it, the better your
                chances of success in the long run.

              <h1>Overreliance on software</h1>
              <p>
                Most people use some form of technology to assist their trading.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, you might study chart patterns or use automated
                alerts and algorithms as prompts to trade.
              </p>
              <p>
                But, as useful as all of these tools are, it is important to
                remember that they are only tools, and must be employed wisely.
              </p>
              <p>
                Just as your satnav can occasionally direct you to drive into a
                deep torrent of water because it doesn't know the river has
                flooded, trading technology isn't something to follow blindly.
                You still need to keep your eyes open and react intelligently to
                the signs you see.

                So when using technology, such as charting software or other
                analysis tools, it's important that you understand the
                underlying concepts and the reasons behind what the charts are
                telling you. This will allow you to see the bigger picture and
                avoid unnecessary mistakes.
              </p>
              <h1>Lack of record keeping</h1>
              <p>
                Do you remember your first trade? What about the third, or the
                fifth?
              </p>
              <p>
                If you're new to trading, the details may still be clear in your
                memory. But in a few months' time will you still be able to
                describe each step and decision in detail?
              </p>
              <p>
                Unless you keep a trading log or diary, the chances are that
                this information will be lost. And if you can't remember what
                you did right, how can you replicate it? Similarly, if you don't
                know where you went wrong you could easily make the same
                mistakes again.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your trading diary will let you look back at your experiences
                with the value of hindsight and learn from them. So what should
                you record in it?

              <h1>Bad timing</h1>
              <p>
                Timing is not only the art of good comedy -&nbsp;it's also
                central to good trading.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the same way that a stand-up artist needs to deliver the
                punchline at exactly the right moment, you need to time your
                entry and exit from a market perfectly to maximise any profit or
                minimise any loss.
              </p>
              <p>
                Timing mistakes are common among new traders. So how can you
                avoid them? Although getting your timing right isn't an exact
                science, there are a few tools that will help you to act at the
                right moment:
              </p>

                  A <b>trading plan</b> will help you to define your strategy,

                It's inevitable -&nbsp;sometimes things don't go to plan and you
                end up with a running loss on a position. There will be times
                when you can ride out the storm and eventually turn a profit,
                but on some occasions it's best to quit before the situation

                Inexperienced traders might assume the answer is 'yes', but in

                Generally this is determined by macro-economic influences rather
                than individual political or economic events. So, in our

                initial volatility subsides.

                There's an abundance of software available to analyse market
                trends, and these tools can be valuable if used correctly. You
                should just be careful to distinguish between short-term and
                long-term influences, as these may not be aligned.
