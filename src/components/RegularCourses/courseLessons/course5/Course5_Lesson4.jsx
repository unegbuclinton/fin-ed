                Sometimes, your patterns of behaviour come about as a result of
                subtle influences. A bias can affect your judgment to such an
                extent that your decisions might go against all conventional
                wisdom.
              </p>
              <p>
                Everyone has biases. They play a massive part in everyday life.
                You may buy a certain product at the supermarket because it's a
                brand you recognise, or read a particular newspaper because it
                backs up what you already believe.

                There's no way to get rid of bias altogether, but if you're
                aware of how it may manifest itself, you stand a much better
                chance of minimising the impact on your trading.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Representative bias</b>: Let's say you've been watching a
                market which has recently followed an uptrend. You take a
                position which, on this occasion, pays off. At a later date, you
                see the same market following an almost identical trend. Because
                of representative bias, you assume that, if you make the same
                trade again, you'll repeat your success. But even if two trades
                seem similar on the surface, it's key you treat every
                circumstance as unique.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Negativity bias</b>: Looking back on a past trade, you might
                only see what went wrong. A particularly tough loss, or series
                of losses, will cause you to overlook any positive results
                you've had -&nbsp;and the equally positive decisions that led to
                them.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Gambler's Fallacy</b>: If a market goes up for three straight
                days, Gambler's Fallacy says that it is likely to go up on the
                fourth. But beyond your own imagination, there's nothing to link
                events of the past to events of the future.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Status quo bias</b>: Instead of looking for new ideas, you
                might be inclined to use those that have proved successful in
                the past -&nbsp;even if, objectively, they're no longer
                worthwhile.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Confirmation bias</b>: Maybe you're confident the stock
                market is going to rise. With confirmation bias, you see only
                the news and information that supports your view, and gloss over
                anything that contradicts it.

                Loss-aversion bias: You won't close an unprofitable position,
                holding onto the trade in the hope that it will end up paying
                itself off. This is similar to endowment bias, where you
                perceive those trades you've made as having a lot more potential
                than those you decided not to make. In both cases, when the
                price moves against you, you'll be reluctant to let go.
              </p>
              <p>
                Herd bias: It's human nature to do exactly what everyone around
                you is doing, and traders are as susceptible to this as anyone.
                You need to have the confidence to make decisions based on your
                own research and trading plan - and to stick by these decisions
                when you've made them.

                In this course so far we've looked at how to control emotions
                that can be harmful to traders. So let's now consider which
                personal characteristics you <b>should</b> aim to develop, if
                you want to get the best out of your trading:

                  We all tend to think in certain ways, but try to stay as

                  Successful traders are generally calm and disciplined. They
                  know their own limits, and they follow a clear plan to reach
                  their trading goals
