                Some types of emotion can affect the clarity of your thinking,
                and so impact any trading decisions you make.
              </p>
              <h1>Anger</h1>
              <p>
                A losing trade can make you furious -&nbsp;often simply with
                yourself, for making a bad decision.
              </p>
              <p>
                But we all make mistakes -&nbsp;it's an important way to learn.
                If it happens to you, as it inevitably will one day, put it down
                to experience and make a mental note about what to do
                differently next time.
              </p>
              <p>
                One common impulse in moments of anger is to try and 'get back
                at the market' by placing another trade. This sort of knee-jerk
                reaction -&nbsp;or '<b>hair-trigger trade</b>' -&nbsp;is nearly
                always a bad idea. Alternatively, you might just start buying
                anything and everything indiscriminately. This is known as '
                <b>shotgun trading</b>'.
              </p>
              <p>
                Take a moment to sit back and breathe deeply, then consider
                objectively whether your proposed trade really makes sense and
                is in line with your overall trading strategy.

              <h1>Regret</h1>
              <p>
                Another common source of annoyance is missing an opportunity
                -&nbsp;something that's easy to do in the fast-moving world of
                financial markets.
              </p>
              <p>
                When this happens, it's easy to give yourself a hard time about
                it, repeating things like 'I should have bought there' or 'I
                knew that was going to happen'. But this sort of mentality can
                lure you into traps capable of undoing all your hard work at a
                stroke.
              </p>
              <p>
                You might, for example, be tempted to place a belated trade
                anyway, or to risk placing a number of trades in quick
                succession -&nbsp;known as <b>overtrading</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;to set
                things right. You might even '<b>go on tilt</b>', a particular
                state of mind which means you make irrational decisions, rather
                than those based on the merit of what's right in front of you.
              </p>
              <p>
                That's why, if the moment has passed, you need a few tricks to
                remain clear-headed until the next signal comes along.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fortunately, those tricks are as simple as taking a break,
                casting an eye over your original trading plan and exercising a
                positive mentality -&nbsp;remember, missing a move is not the
                end of the world.
              </p>
              <h1>Sentimentality</h1>
              <p>
                Suppose you've traded gold several times, and each time you've
                made a healthy profit. It might be tempting to start believing
                (perhaps subconsciously) that 'gold is your friend', and that it
                will reward you in the same way every time.

                Once this conviction grows, there's a danger that you'll open
                further positions in gold without properly considering the
                current situation.
              </p>

                Unfortunately, the fact that a particular instrument has been
                profitable in the past is no guarantee that it will continue to
                perform for you. But likewise, if you've had a bad experience
                with a certain asset that's no reason to shy away from any
                future opportunities it offers.
              </p>
              <h1>Stress</h1>
              <p>
                There are times in all of our lives when events beyond our
                control affect our ability to think clearly.
              </p>
              <p>
                It could be divorce, family illness, bereavement, or just moving
                house or changing jobs. All of these things will distract you
                from trading and could cloud your judgment.
              </p>
              <p>
                The world of financial trading can be hectic, demanding your
                undivided attention. So when you're going through stressful
                periods, it's often safest to put your trading on hold until you
                can commit the necessary time and energy to it again.

                <li>
                  Don't beat yourself up about poor decisions or missed
                  opportunities. Learn from your mistakes and look forward to
                  getting it right next time
                </li>
                <li>
                  To avoid going on tilt when things go wrong, take a break,
                  remind yourself of your trading plan, and wait until you're
                  back in a positive state of mind
                </li>
                <li>
                  Remember that sentimentality and superstition have no place in
                  trading. No market is your friend or enemy, and every
                  opportunity should be assessed on its merits
                </li>
                <li>
                  When you're suffering from stress in other areas of your life,
                  it may be wise to put your trading on hold
