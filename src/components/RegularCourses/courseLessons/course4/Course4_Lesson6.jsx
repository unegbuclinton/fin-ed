                  &nbsp;Day trading
                </h1>
                <p>
                  This type of trading involves opening and closing a small
                  number of trades in the same day.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Positions are not held overnight, eliminating the exposure to
                  large overnight moves when it could be difficult or impossible
                  to get out of the trade -&nbsp;eg if you're in bed, or the
                  underlying market is closed. Instead, day traders generally
                  prefer to monitor the markets throughout the trading day
                  waiting for the ideal conditions to enter, and then exit,
                  their positions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This means day trading tends to be a very time-intensive
                  activity, often requiring traders to check market prices, news
                  and data regularly looking for entry opportunities and exit
                  strategies. So, if you're a very busy person or have a
                  full-time job, you'll need to consider whether you can devote
                  enough time to monitoring and analysing the markets to be
                  successful using this approach.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Day traders tend to rely on technical analysis more than
                  fundamental analysis, as emerging chart patterns and
                  indicators can often provide strong short-term signals to
                  trade. However, if you decide to trade using this style, it's
                  still very important to know which major economic events are
                  coming up each day, as these frequently cause market
                  volatility and significant shifts in sentiment and momentum.

                  Scalping
                </h1>
                <p>
                  Scalping is the shortest-term style of trading and involves
                  placing dozens, sometimes hundreds, of trades per day. Each
                  trade is usually held from between just a few seconds, to a
                  few minutes at the most.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The principle behind scalping is to open a trade and then exit
                  it as soon as the market moves a certain small amount in your
                  favour -&nbsp;so making a slight profit on each trade. If the
                  market moves against you at any time, you close the trade and
                  take a small loss.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The idea is to pick a market trending in a particular
                  direction so you end up winning more trades than you lose. If
                  the trend changes direction, you change the direction of your
                  trades as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Scalping is an extremely intense form of trading requiring
                  high levels of concentration over an extended period of time.
                  It is essentially just a faster-paced version of day trading
                  and, of course, you don't hold any positions overnight. This
                  means your risk per trade is by far the smallest of any of the
                  styles, though the potential rewards are lower too.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The best time to trade is generally when the market is
                  trending strongly up or down and there's a lot of liquidity.
                  This enables you to place trades in the direction of the trend
                  then get out of them quickly as soon as the market moves.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When scalping you need to be particularly disciplined and not
                  get distracted by chasing large profits or letting losses run.
                  No one trade will be especially profitable, so you need to
                  place a huge number of trades if you want to make significant
                  gains.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For this reason, scalping is the most time-intensive style
                  with traders often entering and exiting positions for several
                  hours at a time, every day.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Due to the very short-term nature of the trades, scalpers tend
                  to use technical chart analysis almost exclusively to identify
                  trending markets. However, you still need to be aware of which
                  economic announcements are scheduled for that day, as any
                  surprising data could cause markets to gap, or trends to
                  reverse.

              <h1>Sticking with it</h1>
              <p>
                You should now have a fairly good idea about which style of
                trading will suit you best, based on:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Your personality</li>
                <li>Attitude to risk</li>
                <li>Amount of time you can commit to trading</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                After choosing a style it's generally considered sensible to
                stick with it for at least a few weeks to determine whether it's
                right for you. Continually changing your style whenever you have
                a losing streak means you can't adapt and improve your trading
                plan effectively and can also lead to a loss of discipline.
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember that <b>all traders</b> will endure a painful losing
                streak at some point. What separates successful traders from
                those that get wiped out quickly, is how they prepare for that
                inevitable streak, and how they react after it.
