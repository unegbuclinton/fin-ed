              <h3>Always be aware of the downside</h3>
              <p>
                Before you place every trade you should calculate exactly how
                much you stand to lose in the worst case scenario. Remember that
                sometimes the market can move quickly or gap, meaning you might
                not be able to get out of your trade at the level you wanted to.
              </p>
              <p>
                You need to keep the worst case scenario in mind, because if
                there's a major market event, you may be overly exposed. This is
                particularly important to remember when placing leveraged
                trades, where your losses could be greater than your deposit.
              </p>
              <h3>Avoid emotional trading</h3>
              <p>
                When making trading decisions, you should distinguish between
                those which are rational and those which are emotional. Relying
                on 'gut'&nbsp;feeling will almost certainly end in disaster, so
                it's vital to back up your decisions with clear analysis. As
                we've seen earlier, creating a structured trading plan can help
                you manage emotional risk by providing clear guidelines and
                helping you maintain your discipline.
              </p>
              <h3>Diversify</h3>
              <p>
                If you often have more than one position open at any one time,
                you can help minimise risk by putting your money into a broad
                range of different investments â€“&nbsp;in other words, not
                putting all your eggs in one basket.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, if you put all your investment capital into the
                shares of a single company, you risk losing it all if that
                company goes bust. On the other hand, if you buy shares in many
                different companies, your loss from the one that fails won't
                have such a devastating effect on your overall investment.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, even spreading your capital across a range of different
                shares can't protect you from systemic risk factors that can
                affect the stock market as a whole.
              </p>
              <p>
                Therefore the best way to diversify is to spread your investment
                across asset classes. For example, you may end up having a
                portfolio made up of shares, commodities, property, bonds and
                other investments. These markets often move independently of
                each other, providing protection against one particular asset
                class underperforming.
              </p>
              <h3>Select riskier investments carefully</h3>
              <p>
                If you do end up having a portfolio of different investments,
                it's sensible to balance out any particularly risky trades with
                more stable assets. The investment risk pyramid is a handy model
                to help you decide how to spread your risk across various
                financial instruments.

                Most traders will probably want to keep the bulk of their
                investments in safe assets that provide regular, if
                unspectacular, returns. These are represented by the pyramid's
                base.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the middle there are medium-risk assets, which should provide
                a stable return and also have the potential to appreciate.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the top are the higher-risk investments which have the
                potential for huge returns but large losses too. The money you
                put into these high-risk assets should only be money that you
                can afford to lose without serious financial repercussions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Of course, the pyramid acts as a guide rather than a set of
                rules, so you'll need to think carefully about the amount of
                time and money you have to invest, and the level of return you
                want to achieve when choosing which assets to trade.

                    We've looked at some general methods of managing your risk,
                    now here are two practical techniques you can use to work
                    out exactly how much risk you should be taking on with each
                    trade.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Calculate your maximum risk per trade</h3>
                  <p>
                    Choosing how much to risk per trade is all about your
                    personal circumstances. You'll find some guidance that says
                    don't risk more than 1% of your trading capital per trade,
                    while others say it's ok to go up to 10%. Most traders agree
                    not to go much higher than that though, and here's why...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you go on a big losing streak, the amount you're risking
                    per trade will have a huge effect on your capital and the
                    ability to claw back your losses. Say you've got $10,000 of
                    trading capital and you're unlucky enough to lose 15 trades
                    in a row. Here's the difference between risking 2%, 5% or
                    10% per trade:

                      With 2% risk per trade, even after 15 losses you've lost
                      less than 25% of your trading capital. It's conceivable
                      that you can win this money back.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      However, if you'd gone for 5% risk per trade, you'd have
                      lost <b>over half</b> your initial trading capital. You'd
                      have to more than double this amount to get to your
                      original level.

                    <li>
                      With 10% risk per trade, things are even worse. You'd be
                      down <b>over 75%</b> making it extremely difficult to make
                      back the money you've lost.

                  <p>
                    The reduction of capital after a series of losing trades is
                    called a <b>drawdown</b>. It's important to work out what
                    percentage drawdown will make it difficult to reach your
                    trading goals, and then ensure your maximum risk per trade
                    is in line with that.

                    Based on this information, you can also work out a{" "}

                    Of course, if you're a long-term investor only making a few
                    select share trades per year, then 10% risk per trade might
                    make complete sense. But if you're a high-frequency forex
                    trader making over a hundred transactions per day, then even
                    2% per trade could be far too high. It all depends on you
                    and how you like to trade.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Remember, all traders will be affected by a losing streak at
                    some stage, but the ones who plan their trading to cope with
                    those streaks are usually more successful in the long run.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Work out the risk vs reward ratio of every trade</h3>
                  <p>
                    It is possible to lose more times than you win, yet be
                    consistently profitable. It's all down to risk vs reward.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To find the ratio on a particular trade, simply compare the
                    amount of money you're risking to the potential gain. So if
                    your maximum potential loss on a trade is $200 and the
                    maximum potential gain is $600, then the risk vs reward
                    ratio is 1:3.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If, for example, you placed ten trades with this ratio and
                    you were successful on just three of those trades, your
                    profit and loss figures might look like this:

                    Over ten trades you could have made $400, despite only being
                    right 30% of the time. That's why many traders like to stick
                    to a risk/reward ratio of 1:3 or better.

                  <p>
                    A word of warning though â€“&nbsp;if you're taking on less
                    risk for a greater potential reward, it's likely the market
                    will have to move further in your favour to reach your
                    maximum profit, than it will to hit your maximum loss.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, in the above example, the market would probably have to
                    move three times as far in your favour to reach a $600
                    profit, than it would have to move against you to cause a
                    $200 loss.

                    You can't control whether a market goes up or down, but you
                    can control your risk -&nbsp;so it's vital to have an
                    effective risk management strategy in place
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    To manage risk effectively you should:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Always be aware of the maximum potential downside</li>
                      <li>Avoid emotional trading</li>
                      <li>Diversify your investments</li>
                      <li>Select riskier trades carefully</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Always calculate your maximum risk per trade:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Generally, risking under 2% of your total trading
                        capital per trade is considered sensible
                      </li>
                      <li>Anything over 5% is usually considered high risk</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Work out the risk vs reward ratio of every trade:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        It is possible to lose more times than you win, yet be
                        consistently profitable
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Many traders like to stick to a risk/reward ratio of 1:3
                        or better
                      </li>
                    </ul>
