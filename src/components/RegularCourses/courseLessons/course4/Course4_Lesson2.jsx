                How to make a trading plan?
              </h1>
              <p>
                All trading plans are personal and unique, so there's no set
                formula for creating the perfect plan. However, most should
                address the following in some capacity:
              </p>
              <h3>Motivation</h3>
              <p>
                Why do you want to become a trader? Is it for the money, for the
                excitement, or simply to learn more about how the financial
                markets work? Whatever it is, it's a good idea to write it down
                because your motivation is an essential part of who you are as a
                trader.
              </p>
              <h3>Time commitment</h3>
              <p>
                Before you get down to the real business of trading, it's
                sensible to work out how much time you can commit to it.
                Individuals looking to make a large number of trades per day,
                for example, will need to dedicate a lot more time to trading
                than, say, investors looking to buy assets that will appreciate
                over several years.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's also important to spend enough time preparing yourself for
                trading, which includes education, practising your strategies
                and analysing the markets.
              </p>
              <h3>Trading goals</h3>
              <p>
                Once you've written down your motivation for trading and the
                amount of time you're willing to commit, you can start defining
                your trading goals. These goals shouldn't simply be grand
                statements about how you're going to buy a big house or a yacht
                with your winnings. To be effective, trading goals&nbsp;need to
                be Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound. In
                short, they need to be SMART:

              <h3>Attitude to risk</h3>
              <p>
                Market prices are always changing and even the safest financial
                instruments carry some degree of risk. An investment that seems
                like an exciting opportunity to one person may feel dangerous
                and stressful to another. So before you start trading it's
                important to work out how much risk you're prepared to take on,
                both for each individual trade and over your trading strategy as
                a whole.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your attitude to risk usually goes hand-in-hand with your
                trading goals. For example, a trader looking to make 100%
                returns every year might be happy to take on increased risk to
                achieve the objective. While a more conservative investor might
                only want to risk a small amount of investment capital to
                realise 10% yearly growth.
              </p>
              <h3>Trading capital</h3>
              <p>
                It's now time to get serious and look at money. Specifically
                your money and how much of it you can afford to dedicate to
                trading. This is your <b>trading capital.</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                It should go without saying, but it's vital that you
                <b>don't risk more than you can afford to lose.</b>
              </p>

                While no one trades to lose money, you need to be aware that
                some traders do end up losing their entire trading capital and
                sometimes a lot more besides. You always need to make sure you
                can afford the maximum potential loss on every trade, so do the
                maths every time you open a position. And if you don't have
                enough at the moment, practise trading on a demo account until
                you do.
              </p>
              <h3>Markets to trade</h3>
              <p>
                With so many markets available, how do you choose which one to
                start with?
              </p>
              <p>
                Research is an essential part of trading, so it makes sense to
                begin by looking at the markets you have a particular interest
                in. If you like to keep up with technology trends or retail
                companies for example, then trading on stocks in these
                industries is likely to come more naturally than speculating on
                commodities such as corn or cattle.
              </p>
              <p>It's also crucial to look at the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Trading times</b>&nbsp;–&nbsp;when is the market open?
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Volatility</b>&nbsp;–&nbsp;on average, how many points does
                  this market move in an hour/day/week?
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Position/contract size</b>&nbsp;–&nbsp;how much will you
                  gain or lose for every point of movement in the price?
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                If these factors don't fit with how you want to trade, or your
                attitude to risk, then pick another market.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once you've made your decision, it's important to stay focused.
                The more you understand about your market and why the price
                moves, the more likely you'll be able to predict future
                movements with accuracy.

              <h3>Record keeping</h3>
              <p>
                For a trading plan to work it needs to be backed up by a trading
                diary.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is where you record everything that happens during a trade,
                including why you entered it, the expected profit and maximum
                risk, the entry point, exit point and how the market behaved
                during the trade. You should also record how you felt before,
                during and after the trade, as this will help you keep your
                discipline and avoid making decisions based on emotion.
              </p>
              <p>
                If, for example, you closed a trade early because you were
                afraid the market was going to turn –&nbsp;write that down. Did
                the market continue in your favour to reach your target level,
                or did it move against you as you thought? Record why you
                decided to deviate from your plan. Did your emotions get the
                better of you, or does your plan need revision?
              </p>
              <p>
                Record keeping also enables you to see how you're performing
                over a period of time:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Are you generally profitable or are you losing money?</li>
                <li>What's your win percentage?</li>
                <li>
                  When you win, is it usually by more or less than when you
                  lose?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Are particular markets/times of day/trade setups more
                  profitable than others?
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Keeping track of these statistics will enable you to become a
                better trader and help you on the way to achieving your goals.
