                As the name implies, the stock market (or stock exchange) is a
                marketplace where shares in public companies are bought and
                sold. Its role is to give private investors a way to become
                partial owners of a business to benefit from the profits it
                generates over time. It also helps listed companies raise
                capital through investors that they can use to grow their
                business.

                Shares are listed on a particular market in a specific country,
                such as the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in the UK. When a
                company wants to sell shares through an exchange, it has to
                apply to become ‘listed’. Once approved, it will have to follow
                the rules set out by the local financial services regulatory
                institution.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules
                the US market. It requires that all publicly listed companies
                disclose their quarterly financial results three times each year
                and publish an annual report in the fourth quarter.
              </p>
              <p>
                This gives investors an overview of the company’s financial
                standing throughout the year, and helps them compare performance
                over certain periods before making any investment decisions.
                Buying a listed company therefore comes with certain safeguards
                for investors.

              <p>
                Because the SEC’s financial reporting obligations happen four
                times a year, the reporting periods are usually referred to as
                ‘earnings season’. For many major companies, these reports are
                released around January/February, April/May, July and between
                September and November.
              </p>
              <p>
                Earnings season reports outlay important details around a
                company’s financial performance, so they often cause
                fluctuations in its share price as investors buy and sell their
                stock. For this reason, many companies release their results
                outside of market hours so as not to disrupt the trading day.

                When an exchange is open, stock prices will fluctuate constantly
                as shareholders buy and sell shares based on sentiment about the
                company’s prospects and how investors react to economic and
                political events.
              </p>
              <p>
                Shares in a company may go up or down at any time, but they
                usually respond directly to news about the business or the
                sector it’s in. If a company reports increased profits, for
                example, or if it promises a dividend increasing faster than
                inflation, then its share price is likely to rise.

              <p>
                As well as the prospect of your investments growing in value,
                you can also look to buy shares to benefit from dividends. These
                are portions of a company’s profits that are usually distributed
                among shareholders as a one-off or regular cash payment, but can
                also be paid in property or further shares of stock.

                The 100 biggest companies listed on the LSE form the FTSE 100
                index, which aggregates the share price movements of all its
                constituent companies.

                A stock index is a group of shares that are used to give an
                indication of a sector, exchange or economy’s performance. It’s
                made up of a set number of the top-performing shares (called
                constituents) from a given exchange. For example, the FTSE 100
                is an important indicator of the UK stock market and economic
                health.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may have also heard of the DAX which tracks the top 40
                stocks on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FSE), and the Dow Jones
                Industrial Average which tracks the top 30 companies on the New
                York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the National Association of
                Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ).

                Over the course of 2021, the FTSE 100 rose by 14.3%, its best
                year since 2016, and generated a further 3.37% in cumulative
                dividends – that’s an annual total return of more than 18%.
                While this gives a good indication of the returns the stock
                market can produce, remember that past performance is not a
                guarantee of future results.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you’re investing in the stock market, you could do this by
                ‘buying’ a stock index like the FTSE 100. But since an index
                isn’t a listed entity, this would involve purchasing shares in
                each of its 100 constituent companies – a complex and costly
                process.
              </p>
              <p>
                You could, alternatively, pool your money with other investors
                in a fund that offers exposure to the same companies. The
                cheapest way to ‘buy’ an index is with an exchange-traded fund
                or ETF (more on this shortly).

              <h3 class="heading">What is an ETF?</h3>
              <p>
                An ETF is a type of investment fund that’s bought and sold on
                stock exchanges. ETFs are designed to track the performance of a
                group of companies that form an index (like the FTSE 100) or
                sectors such as energy, agriculture and healthcare. They can
                also track individual markets like gold, oil or the US dollar.

                The price of an ETF reflects the collective value of the assets
                it tracks. For example, a FTSE-tracking ETF might hold shares in
                all of the FTSE 100’s constituent companies. Its value will be
                based on the share price of each company, so if one rises in
                value, the price of the ETF will also rise.
              </p>
              <p>
                Like stocks, ETFs are shares that you can buy or sell on an
                exchange. This means you can gain exposure to the performance of
                an entire index or sector with just a single investment.
              </p>
              <p>
                For instance, instead of buying shares in many individual energy
                companies, you could buy shares in one ETF that tracks the
                energy sector. From one transaction, you’d gain broad exposure
                to the industry’s combined performance, and subsequently have
                only one investment to monitor and manage.
              </p>
              <p>
                ETFs offer a low-cost way to invest in a wide range of equities,
                bonds, property, commodities and other assets. They’re also free
                from stamp duty in the UK.<sup>1</sup> However, it’s important
                to read an ETF’s prospectus or Key Investor Information Document
                (KIID) before you invest.
