                Forex, also known as foreign exchange, FX or the currency
                market, is the largest financial market in the world. On average
                over <b>$5 trillion</b> worth of transactions take place every
                day. That's around 100 times more than the New York Stock
                Exchange (NYSE) -&nbsp;the world's biggest stock exchange.
              </p>
              <p>
                As well as being traded by individuals and businesses, forex is
                also important for financial institutions, central banks, and
                governments. It facilitates international trade and investment
                by allowing companies that earn money in one currency to pay for
                goods and services in another.

              <p>
                There are a huge number of market participants looking to trade
                forex at any particular time, from individual speculators
                wanting to turn a quick profit, to central banks trying to
                control the amount of currency in circulation.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, by far the most significant players in the forex market
                are the major international banks. Between them, Citigroup,
                Deutsche Bank, Barclays, JPMorgan and UBS account for around 50%
                of global forex trade.

              <h1 className="heading">Why do people trade forex?</h1>
              <p>
                Individuals and businesses participate in the forex market for
                two main reasons:
              </p>
              <h3>Speculation</h3>
              <p>
                The vast majority of forex transactions are made simply to make
                money. This means the person or institution making the trade has
                no plans to take delivery of the currency, they are just looking
                to turn a profit on movements in the market.
              </p>
              <p>
                With major financial institutions always looking to profit from
                small changes in forex prices, many large trades can occur
                throughout the day. This activity means currency rates are some
                of the most consistently volatile financial markets in the world
                -&nbsp;which in turn provides more opportunity for speculators
                to make money.
              </p>
              <h3>Purchasing goods or services in another currency</h3>
              <p>
                Every time a transaction is made between two entities in
                different regions, a foreign exchange transaction needs to take
                place to pay for the goods or services exchanged. Transactions
                such as this happen globally, every second of every day.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite the number of transactions, the amount of currency
                traded is often very small compared to trades made by large
                speculators. Therefore commercial trading tends not to have such
                a big effect on short-term market rates.
              </p>
              <h1>How do you trade forex?</h1>
              <p>
                Unlike share trading, forex is an over-the-counter (OTC) market.
                This means that currencies are exchanged directly between two
                parties rather than through an exchange.
              </p>
              <p>
                The forex market is run electronically via a global network of
                banks -&nbsp;it has no central location, and trades can take
                place anywhere via a forex broker of your choice. This also
                means that you can trade forex at any time, so long as it's
                during trading hours in any one of the four major forex trading
                centres (London, New York, Sydney and Tokyo).

                In practice, that means you can trade most forex pairs from
                around 21:00 or 22:00 (UK time) on Sunday to 21:00 or 22:00 (UK
                time) on Friday, every week. The exact times can vary due to
                daylight saving time changes in the UK, USA and Australia.
              </p>
              <h1 className="heading">How does a forex trade work?</h1>
              <p>
                Forex prices are always quoted in <b>pairs</b> such as AUD/EUR,
                which stands for the Australian dollar versus the euro. This is
                because if you want to purchase Australian dollars you need to
                buy them with another currency, like euros.
              </p>
              <p className="definition">
                When trading forex you are simultaneously BUYING one currency
                while SELLING another.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each currency in a pair is known by a three letter currency
                code. In general the first two letters stand for the
                country/region, and the last letter represents the currency. So
                taking USD/JPY as an example:
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>USD</b> stands for the US dollar, while <b>JPY</b> represents
                the Japanese yen.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div className="lesson-content parbase section">
            <div className="lesson-type-default">
              <p>
                The first currency in every forex pair is called the <b>base</b>
                or <b>primary</b> currency. The second currency is known as the
                <b>quote</b> or <b>counter</b> currency. A forex price indicates
                how much one unit of the base currency will buy of the quote
                currency. So, if you see the following quote:
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>EUR/USD = 1.20164</b>
              </p>
              <p>This means one euro is worth 1.20164 dollars.</p>
              <p>
                You would buy this pair if you think the base currency, the
                euro, will strengthen against the quote currency, the dollar.
                This is known as going <b>long</b>. Or, you could sell the pair
                if you believe the euro will weaken -&nbsp;this is going
                <b>short.</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                In the next lesson, we'll take a closer look at the terminology
                involved in forex trading.
