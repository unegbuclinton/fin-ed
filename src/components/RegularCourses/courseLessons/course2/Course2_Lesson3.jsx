                The relationship between them powers the movements in market
                prices. Let's look at how that works.
              </p>
              <p>
                Suppose you were buying a car â€“ you'd look for the lowest price
                on the model you wanted. And if other buyers were thin on the
                ground you might strike a good deal. On the other hand, if you
                were trying to bag a rare and sought-after vehicle, you might
                have to pay the seller a high price.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the same way, the balance of demand from buyers and supply
                from sellers influences prices in financial markets.

              <p>
                When you look at a quote for a financial asset, you'll generally
                see not one but two prices:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Bid price&nbsp;</b>- the price you'll receive as a seller
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Ask price</b> - the price you'll pay as a buyer
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>The ask price is also known as the 'offer price'.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="lesson-type-default">
              <p className="definition">
                In a quote, the lower figure shown is normally the bid price and
                the higher is the ask price.

              <h1 className="heading">The spread</h1>
              <p>So why do different prices apply for buyers and sellers?</p>
              <p>
                The gap between the bid and ask prices occurs because buyers and
                sellers often have contrasting views about the value of an
                asset:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The bid price is the highest price at which a buyer is
                  prepared to buy
                </li>
                <li>
                  The ask price is the lowest price for which a seller is
                  willing to sell
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The difference between the two prices is known as the 'spread',
                and also as the 'bid-ask spread' or 'bid-offer spread'.
              </p>
              <p>
                The spread may also incorporate a broker's fee for handling the
                trade. The broker quotes clients a price slightly lower than the
                fundamental bid price or slightly higher than the ask price,
                keeping the difference to cover its costs.

                  The balance between supply (sellers) and demand (buyers)

                </li>
                <li>
                  The bid price is the price you'll receive as a seller, while
                  the ask price (or offer price) is the price you'll pay as a

                  The gap between the bid and ask prices is called the spread,
                  and occurs because buyers and sellers often have differing
