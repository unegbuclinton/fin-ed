                The world of finance can be intimidating for most beginners. For
                this reason, some new investors opt to buy into fully managed
                portfolios where an expert makes all the decisions on their
                behalf.

                If you wanted to buy shares in the past, you would’ve needed to
                do so through a physical stock exchange. However, not just
                anyone could interact with the market the way you can today.
              </p>
              <p>
                Traditional stock markets had strict rules for participants, and
                ordinary people had to buy and sell shares through a stockbroker
                who was a formal member of the exchange. These days, the term
                ‘stockbroker’ usually refers to companies that facilitate buying
                and selling shares.

                The good news is that anyone can participate in the markets
                today, and you can build and manage your own portfolio if you
                have a good strategy in place. You might make a few mistakes
                when you start out, but you’ll improve as you gain more
                investment experience.

                Outside of the obvious reason of wanting to grow their wealth,
                investors put their money into the markets with different goals
                in mind. For instance, you may feel that you want to retire with
                more money than your existing pension fund will offer you at
                maturity. Maybe you want to save enough money to buy a beach
                house when you retire.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whatever your reasons may be, knowing why you want to invest
                your money and for how long will help you figure out what kind
                of investments to add to your portfolio.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you formulate your goals, it’s better to stretch out your
                timeline. For instance, if you want to raise funds for your
                wedding in three years’ time, you may want to extend this goal
                to five or more years to improve your chances of reaching your
                desired amount.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, note that for short-to-medium-term goals such as this
                one, it may be better to put your money into savings accounts or
                bonds. To truly benefit from investing, giving your portfolio
                ten years or more to compound could be helpful.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is because many factors can affect the value of your
                investments. There’s no predicting how your final return will
                look and you might not reach your goal within your desired
                timeframe.
              </p>
              <h3 className="heading">Step 2: write it down</h3>
              <p>
                To start your strategy, commit to writing it down. Over your
                investment’s lifetime, you’ll need to keep record of all your
                interactions with your portfolio. This can be anything from the
                day you bought an asset and for how much, to the reason you sold
                a certain asset.

              </h2>
              <p>
                Think about some of the reasons you want to grow your money and
                write them down on a Word document, in your email drafts or on a
                piece of paper you can keep safe. You’ll use these when you
                formalise your strategy.

                Having a record will help you keep track of what impact your
                decisions have had on your portfolio as well as pave the way for
                future investments and tax decisions. You can choose to organise
                your portfolio in a complex Excel sheet or simply write it down
                on a document you can easily access when needed.

                Step 3: how will you finance your investment?
              </h3>
              <p>
                You need money to build your portfolio, so your strategy needs
                to outline where you’ll get your capital. For instance, you may
                have a savings account you’ve been building up for a few years
                that you’d be comfortable tapping into for a lump-sum deposit.

                You might also need to continually fund your portfolio if you
                want to keep adding more assets to it. Adding more money to your
                portfolio regularly could improve your chances of reaching your
                goal sooner.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can also smooth your returns by ‘pound-cost averaging’. This
                involves saving and investing into your portfolio on a regular
                basis. It could reduce the overall average price you pay for
                your investments because you can buy more holdings at a lower
                price when markets have fallen. Doing this could potentially
                improve your long-term profits.
              </p>
              <p>
                For instance, if your portfolio invests in XYZ ltd, placing a
                once-off lump sum into it means you’re buying all your shares at
                its current price. If you funded your portfolio at intervals
                instead, the market could fall, giving you the opportunity to
                increase your holdings for less and reap the benefits of its
                potential rise in value over time. Note, however, that you could
                also end up paying more for your additional holdings if the
                market rises.
              </p>
              <p>
                As with your goals, you should write down all the contributions
                you make towards your portfolio. This way, you can clearly see
                if it’s making a profit or if you’re losing money during any
                given period.
              </p>
              <h3 className="heading">
                Step 4: what are your annual profit expectations?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Unlike a savings account, where your cash can only grow by the
                interest rate you receive, an investments portfolio can grow
                through the increasing value of your shares or bond. You can
                also reinvest your dividends or coupon payments to further
                accelerate growth.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your goal is to work out how much your capital will need to grow
                by each year to reach the investment goals you set. Online
                compound interest calculators are useful here. You can try out
