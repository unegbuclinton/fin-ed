                Now you’ll need to introduce a little reality check. There are
                risks involved with investing. You need to think carefully about
                everything that could derail your wealth-building and develop a
                plan for how you’ll deal with these situations should they
                arise.
              </p>
              <p>
                Below are a few tips that will help you plan for almost any
                future risk.
              </p>
              <h3 className="heading">
                Check the average returns of the market you plan to invest in
              </h3>
              <p>
                If you’ve never invested before, it’s impossible to guess how
                much you can expect to profit from a particular asset. Your
                strategy should therefore include the market’s average annual
                returns. Remember, this is just to give you an idea of past
                performance, but there’s no guarantee that these results will
                continue after you put your money up.
              </p>
              <p>
                Knowing how much you can expect to gain each year will be useful
                in choosing investments that could help you reach your goal. It
                can also help you adjust your strategy if needed, since you’ll
                be able to see if your goal is attainable in your preferred
                timeframe.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let’s say you need your capital to grow by 10% per year for the
                next ten years to reach your goal. You consider investing in a
                FTSE 100-tracking ETF, so you look at how the index has
                performed over the last decade. If you found that the FTSE 100
                only returned 5% per year in that period, you may need to adjust
                your strategy to reach your goal.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div className="lesson-content parbase section">
            <div className="lesson-type-default">
              <p>
                Choosing an investment with higher returns sounds like the most
                logical decision to make, so why isn’t it the only answer in the
                exercise above? Well, because an asset or market that yields
                more returns may also be one that’s prone to higher levels of
                volatility and thus risk.
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember, investing is a long-term endeavour, so making quick
                money shouldn’t be your goal here. Assets with a better track
                record of consistent returns should ideally make up the majority
                of your portfolio.
              </p>
              <h3 className="heading">Consider how much you might lose</h3>
              <p>
                The main risk of investing is that the value of your investment
                could fall at a time when you need to access your cash. While
                it’s impossible to know how much you could lose on an
                investment, you can get a sense of this by looking at its
                history.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, sometimes unprecedented events can cause a market that
                normally does well to experience a downturn, regardless of its
                past performance. For example, the FTSE 100 had hit a series of
                record highs before the spread of the novel coronavirus in
                2019/2020.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the pandemic hit globally, it brought about a huge drop in
                the index’s performance as lockdowns limited trade across many
                of its constituents. Towards the end of March 2020, the index
                had dropped by close to 34% from its pre-pandemic peak.
              </p>
              <p>
                The FTSE 100 later recovered these losses. But had you invested
                in a FTSE 100-tracking ETF and sold your position before this,
                you would’ve made a significant loss.
              </p>
              <h3 className="heading">Know the right action to take</h3>
              <p>
                Watching your investment drop in value could tempt you to sell
                your stake prematurely. It’s only by studying an asset’s
                patterns in the market that you can understand important details
                about its performance.

                For instance, you might find that Apple’s share price rises
                around the time a new iPhone model is about to launch. After
                this, the stock may drop as investors and traders sell their
                holdings to reap the profits of this temporary rise in value.
              </p>
              <p>
                Had you not known this, this downturn may have scared you into
                selling your shares to avoid losing your funds. However, given
                Apple’s growth history, selling too soon wouldn’t come only at
                the price of the transaction, but also at an opportunity cost.

              <p>
                An opportunity cost is the loss that you make by missing out on
                an occasion to benefit from something. In this context, the
                opportunity cost from selling your Apple stock during a
                temporary downturn would mean you lose out on future profits as
                well as any dividends you could’ve received had you held onto
                your investment longer.

                The earlier scenario on the FTSE 100’s 2020 decline is also a
                great example of why it’s important to do your research before
                making any decisions about your investments.
              </p>
              <p>
                To an inexperienced market participant, the index’s downturn
                would’ve been a signal to jump ship. Considering that the FTSE
                100 later recovered to above pre-pandemic levels, abandoning
                your investment could’ve meant you lost out on the growth that
                followed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Just like a sale in a store, falling share prices may present an
                opportunity to buy. So instead of selling assets that could
                recover in the future, you can instead increase your holdings
                with the hope that the market will bounce back.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you look at an asset’s history, consider factors like how
                much its value fell before it recovered in the past as well as
                the timeframe in which this occurred. Having those details close
                at hand when the markets drop will help you hold steady when the
                price drops again because you’ll understand that falling share
                prices are a normal part of investing. The financial markets are
                volatile, however. So there’s no guarantee that a particular
                asset will return to previous levels as it did in the past.
