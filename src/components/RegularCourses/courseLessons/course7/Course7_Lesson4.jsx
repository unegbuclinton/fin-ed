                Choosing what you want to invest in is the fun part of the
                strategy. As you’d have learned from the beginner course, you
                can invest in more than just stocks or shares. Assets such as
                exchange-traded funds (ETFs), property, gold and many others can
                form part of your portfolio.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this part of the course, you need to start thinking about the
                kind of investments you want to make based on all the
                information you collated in the previous lessons.
              </p>
              <h3 className="heading">Make a shortlist</h3>
              <p>
                Choosing what kind of investments to add to your portfolio
                requires research – both of your own risk profile and of the
                markets. You can find out your risk profile using free online
                calculators. They work by asking you a series of questions about
                your age, life savings, investment knowledge and some of your
                habits, among other things. You’ll then get an assessment of how
                conservative, moderate or aggressive your risk profile is.

                Knowing how much risk you’re willing to take on is important in
                deciding how much volatility you can accept.

                Volatility is a statistical measure of the amount an asset’s
                price changes during a given period of time. It’s a popular way
                of assessing how risky an asset is – the higher the level of
                volatility, the more risk is associated with the asset. Simply
                put, highly volatile assets may see greater fluctuations in
                price over a given time period.

                At this stage, you need to work out which investments will give
                you the returns you need. To get to your shortlist, ask
                yourself:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  What asset classNamees do I want to invest in? These could
                  include a broad-based index using an ETF, individual shares,
                  bonds, property funds and commodities
                </li>
                <li>
                  Is there a sector that interests me, or do I want to invest
                  across multiple sectors?
                </li>
                <li>Are there certain companies I’d like to invest in?</li>
                <li>
                  Am I willing to accept the currency risk from foreign
                  investments?
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div className="lesson-content parbase section">
            <div className="lesson-type-didyouknow">
              <h2 className="lesson-section-title lesson-title-didyouknow">
                Did you know?
              </h2>
              <p>
                Currency risk arises when you exchange one currency to another
                at a less favourable rate. For example, say you’re based in
                Europe and you bought US shares when the exchange rate was
                €1/$1.20. If you sold your holdings when it was at €1/$1, it
                means you’ve lost some value on your investment returns.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div className="lesson-content parbase section">
            <div className="lesson-type-default">
              <p>
                While asking yourself these questions, you should include a list
                of reasons why your chosen assets are good for your plan. Why is
                Company X a better investment than Company Y? Which one will
                better help you achieve your goal? If the answer is ‘both’,
                you’ll still need to consider how much money you’ll put into
                each one based on their performance, level of risk and your
                desired returns.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a situation where the companies are closely related – from
                the same sector, perhaps – you could be introducing
                concentration risk to your portfolio by investing in both of
                them. In such a case, consider selecting the best-performing one
                of the two or splitting your capital equally between them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember to note down the average annual returns of each of your
                potential investments for the same period as your investment
                horizon. If you plan to invest for ten years, find out the
                average annual returns for each of the assets in the last
                decade.

                Now that you’ve given thought to many of the variables that
                could affect your investment outcomes, you may well be ready to
                get started.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the key factors in making an investment strategy work is
                keeping it consistent and not changing it too often. Not only
                can abrupt decisions derail your plans, but any changes you make
                in your portfolio may incur charges. It’s better to adjust your
                portfolio during set periods in the year – whether annually,
                bi-annually or quarterly. Less is better.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can, for example, set aside one day per year to go through
                your strategy again and reflect on how it served you in the
                previous year. During your annual review, you can make any
                changes you deem necessary based on market and economic
                conditions. Make sure you log them in your strategy document so
                you have a record of them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Changing your plan too often defeats the purpose of having one
                in the first place. You can think of your strategy as your North
                Star; it’s there to guide your journey and help you stay on
                course when the markets get choppy.
              </p>
              <p>
                The next course will guide you through refining your strategy.
