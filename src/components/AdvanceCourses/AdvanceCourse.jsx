                Since no human can see into the future, unfortunately new and
                experienced traders alike will sometimes have to contend with
                losing trades.
              </p>
              <p>
                Emotions can run high at these times. Watching your hard-earned
                money being depleted from your account is an uncomfortable
                experience - and it can compromise your decision-making
                abilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                That's why it's important to decide - right at the outset -
                where you'll get out if this trade doesn't go well.
              </p>
              <h1>Rule 1: always have an exit strategy</h1>
              <p>
                You need an exit plan - a strategy for managing the risk of the
                position, so that one bad trade won't wipe out a significant
                chunk of your trading capital. But simply telling yourself where
                you want to get out may not be enough.
              </p>
              <p>
                Consider the scenario: you head to bed for the night with a
                position going well, but by the time you wake up in the morning
                the market has taken a turn against you.
              </p>
              <p>
                Or perhaps you're watching a position while travelling on the
                train. You enter an area with no mobile or wifi service, and by
                the time you get back online the market has moved past your
                planned exit level.

                      immediately starts to rise, putting you into profit.
                      However, suddenly it goes into a sharp reversal, and to
                      your dismay your winning trade rapidly turns into a

                      into wishful thinking as prices continue to
                      deteriorate.Finally, you're left with a feeling of
                      desperation. It's clear that prices aren't coming back

                      In this situation, the financial impact certainly stings.
                      But it's the emotional toll that can make your next trade
                      more complicated, as you try to recover. Just one idea
                      that didn't work out could define how you move forward in
                      a market. For example, you might feel tempted to rush into
                      a new position without proper consideration, in an effort
                      to claw back your losses as quickly as possible.

                    <p>
                      One easy way to help avoid this issue is to decide where
                      to set your stop before opening a position, and set it up
                      while executing the trade, so your position is never left
                      unprotected.

                      With a stop-loss order in place at your pre-defined exit
                      level, if that price is met you don't have to make a
                      decision about to what to do. You've done your planning in
                      advance, and your position is closed for you.&nbsp;

                          In this situation, the financial impact certainly
                          stings. But it's the emotional toll that can make your
                          next trade more complicated, as you try to recover.
                          Just one idea that didn't work out could define how
                          you move forward in a market. For example, you might
                          feel tempted to rush into a new position without
                          proper consideration, in an effort to claw back your
                          losses as quickly as possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          One easy way to help avoid this issue is to decide
                          where to set your stop before opening a position, and
                          set it up while executing the trade, so your position
                          is never left unprotected.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          With a stop-loss order in place at your pre-defined
                          exit level, if that price is met you don't have to
                          make a decision about to what to do. You've done your
                          planning in advance, and your position is closed for
                          you.&nbsp;
